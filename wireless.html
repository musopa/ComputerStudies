      <p>Wireless network refers to any type of computer network that is not connected by cables of any kind&#46; It is a method by which homes&#44; telecommunications networks and enterprise &#40;business&#41; installations avoid the costly process
        of introducing cables into a building&#44; or as a connection between various equipment locations&#46; Wireless telecommunications networks are generally implemented and administered using a transmission system called radio waves&#46; This
        implementation takes place at the physical level &#40;layer&#41; of the OSI model network structure&#46;</p>

      <p>Wireless telecommunications is the transfer of information between two or more points that are not physically connected&#46; Distances can be short&#44; such as a few metres for television remote control&#44; or as far as thousands or even
        millions of kilometres for deep&#45;space radio communications&#46; It encompasses various types of fixed&#44; mobile&#44; and portable two&#45;way radios&#44; cellular telephones&#44; personal digital assistants &#40;PDAs&#41;&#44; and
        wireless networking&#46; Other examples of wireless technology include GPS units&#44; Garage door openers or garage doors&#44; wireless computer mice&#44; keyboards and Headset &#40;audio&#41;&#44; headphones&#44; radio receivers&#44;

      <p>Wireless networks use radio&#44; microwaves and infrared light as transmission media&#44; with wireless technology you can connect cell phones&#44; PDAs or Personal digital assistants&#44; laptops etc together&#44; but the disadvantage of a
        wireless network is it&#39;s a much greater security risk&#44; wireless technologies are implemented at the data link and physical layers of the OSI model&#44; wireless networks work on the IEEE 802&#46;11standard&#46;There are three types of
        wireless topologies Ad&#45;Hoc which uses a peer to peer connection&#44; Infrastructure where all the devices connect via an access point&#44; and a Bridge topology which connects two wireless or wired networks together&#46; Wireless devices
        use one of three transmission methods DSSS or Direct sequence spread spectrum used in the 802&#46;11b wireless radios&#44; FHSS or Frequency hopping spread spectrum these transmissions jump between several frequencies at a pre&#45;determined
        rate or interval and OFDM or Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing used by 802&#46;11a and 802&#46;11g networks this transmits data using multiple carrier waves&#44; each wave carries part of the message&#44; DSSS and FHSS can penetrate
        walls and are less prone to interference and can transmit data over greater distances&#44; OFDM offers a higher data rate over a smaller bandwidth&#44; with resistance to interference with more non&#45;overlapping channels&#46;</p>

    <div class="container">
      <p>Wireless hardware can include PCMCIA cards&#44; Express cards&#44; PC cards&#44; USB or internal PCI cards and mini&#45;PCI cards for laptops&#44; wireless access points&#44; cell phones&#44; and PDAs&#44; you can expand the computers
        functionality by inserting a wireless network interface card into a PC&#44; modern laptops now come with wireless functionality already built in but there may be legacy devices that would need to use network cards like compact flash
        cards&#44;
        PCMCIA cards or external USB devices to give the laptop wireless capability&#44; Windows 2000 does not have wireless support built in but Windows XP has built in wireless support known as Windows wireless zero configuration&#44; Wireless on
        Linux machines can be problematic a utility called NDISwrapper can be used but doesn&#39;t always work&#44; and MACs use AirPort Extreme wireless cards with their computers to add built in wireless capabilities&#44; network cards are built
        around chipsets&#44; the older cards use Hermes or Prism2 chipsets and modern cards use Broadcom or Cisco chipsets among a few other well known brands&#46;</p>

      <p>Antennas are also an important feature in wireless networks utilising many different shapes&#44; sizes and characteristics&#44; the Omni&#45;directional dipole antenna is used with most common wireless access points which resembles a
        doughnut
        shaped sphere of signal transmission covering 360 degrees&#44; there are also semi&#45;directional antennas used to direct the signal to specific areas for precise coverage examples of these include the patch&#44; panel and yagi antennas&#44;
        antennas can work by line of site both visual and with RF radio frequency&#44; the Fresnel zone is a elliptical zone that should be free of RF obstructions and interference&#44; Effected isotropic radiated power EIRP is a measure of
        transmitted
        radio signal power as it leaves the antenna&#44; antennas suffer from interference from electrical devices&#44; weather&#44; attenuation is where the signal weakens over distance&#44; multi&#45;path signals is where reflection and refraction
        can cause problems&#44; to increase coverage of the network boosters and extenders can be used to amplify the signal enabling you to receive&#44; amplify and retransmit the wireless signal increasing the range of the network&#46;</p>

      <p>The wireless access point is used to receive signals to forward on to other devices on the network&#44; hubs&#44; switches&#44; computers&#44; printers etc&#46; Wireless access points are a key piece of hardware that make wireless networks
        feasible&#44; they can provide basic to advanced connection functions&#44; routing and security they can be as simple as hubs or as complicated as routers&#44; firewalls&#44; switches and bridges that employ security&#44; authentication&#44;
        encryption and proxying functions&#44; they are interoperable with multiple wireless standards&#44; usually easily configured through a web interface and can provide both wired and wireless access&#44; a lot of modern access points are
        multifunctional utilising routers&#44; switches and bridges in one device as well as firewall and proxy functionality&#44; their capable of NAT Network address translation which translates IP addresses into MAC addresses&#44; configuring IP
        addresses to block or allow traffic&#44; to block ports and protocols&#46;</p>

      <p>Wireless security issues have additional problems to that of a wired network because they are not enclosed or contained they are physically open because they utilise the airwaves&#44; radio frequencies making it possible to circumvent
        security
        devices&#44; firewalls&#44; routers etc&#44; with radio transmission security becomes more important&#44; you need to use encryption and access control&#44; authentication&#44; authorisation and accounting also play an important role in
        keeping
        the network secure&#46;</p>

    <div class="container">
      <p>You can Manual configure from a web interface&#44; one of the first things to do in configuring the router would be to change the SSID or Service set identifier&#44; it uses a default name and this needs to be changed to a name that is not
        easily figured out by anyone looking to hack into the network&#44; it&#39;s best to disable the broadcast of the SSID as well as a precautionary measure&#44; you may need to adjust the mode settings if the computers on the network are
        different wireless standards from one another&#44; such as 802&#46;11b&#44; 802&#46;11g and 802&#46;11n etc&#44; also the channel frequency may also need to be adjusted if there are other networks nearby creating transmission
        interference&#44; the security mode should be setup for the best available encryption for the network&#46;</p>

      <p>If you can only use WEP encryption it&#39;s better than having none at all but if your network can use WPA or WPA2 encryption then that&#39;s what should be enabled&#44; MAC address filtering should be utilised for additional security
        measures&#44; you can configure the access point so that only the MAC addresses that are authorised by you can only access the network&#44; the firewall should be enabled&#44; with access restrictions you can block URLs to certain computers
        on the network you can also block certain protocols&#44; you should enable a strong password for the router&#46;</p>

      <p>Linux access points usually offer more choices and flexibility&#44; customising the kernel and operating system options&#44; low end hardware can be utilised but requires advanced Linux and networking knowledge&#44; Linux offers a high level
        of security and must be configured in ESS or Extended service set mode&#44; any Linux distribution can be used but needs to be a minimum 2&#46;6 kernel&#46; </p>

        configuration&#44; if you click on the wireless icon in the task bar this will open wireless network connections properties and then you can configure the network settings&#44; in Windows Vista click on start &#45; control panel &#45; network
        and sharing center &#45; manage wireless networks and add a wireless network&#46; Wireless configuration is generally similar with Linux distributions you can use both the command line or the graphical users interface&#44; and Linux supports
        WPA and WPA2 encryption&#44; not all wireless cards have Linux drivers you can use NDISwrapper for some cards which uses drivers intended for Windows&#44; it&#39;s always best to search the vendors web site for Linux driver support&#44; you
        still use the same information as with other clients&#44; in Ubuntu select system &#45; administration &#45; network and network settings and configure the network&#44; you can also use the terminal command line type in <span

        applications and technologies&#44; others such as PDAs&#44; Cell phones etc require a different application programming to fit their needs&#44; e&#45;mail&#44; web browsers&#44; entertainment&#44; music and video etc&#44; some of the wireless
        devices use micro&#45;browsers to view special versions of websites specifically designed for smaller wireless devices&#44; utilising web enabled applications written in WML or Wireless mark&#45;up language instead of HTML&#46; WML is a
        programming language based on XML which formats content for wireless devices&#44; WML pages are stored on a web server and the client&#39;s access the pages using the wireless application protocol or WAP&#44; the pages are accessed through a
        WAP gateway&#44; WML pages use scripting similar to JavaScript usually stored in a separate file&#44; the pages provide the same functionality as normal HTML pages that are translated by the WAP gateway this technology may become unnecessary
        in
        the future as more mobile devices are being built to support XML and HTML&#46;</p>

        all the same brands&#44; security is of upmost importance as most home wireless network access points use default settings to make it easier to setup for the user&#44; home networks can be Ad&#45;Hoc or Infrastructure&#44; Ad&#45;Hoc or
        computer to computer or Independent basic service set&#44; usually setup for quick temporary connections&#44; Infrastructure mode or basic service set where an access point connects a number of wireless devices to a network&#44; some things
        that should be done is change the default SSID name and disable the broadcast&#44; enable encryption WEP or WPA&#47;WPA2, enable MAC address filtering&#44; use DHCP&#44; change the frequency channel if there are other networks nearby causing

      <p>Wireless signals travel as energy usually in waves&#44; the frequency is the number of waves in a given time period usually measured in Hertz cycles per second&#44; common measurements are MHz and GHz and common frequencies are 2&#46;4 and
        5&#46;0 GHz&#44; amplitude the height of the each wave gain/loss is the increase/decrease of amplitude measured in decibels&#44; wireless networking operates in the SHF or super high frequency range of 3 &#45; 30 GHz&#44; waves have certain
        characteristics&#44; reflection happens when a radio wave bounces off an object&#44; refraction is when the radio wave passes through an object but leaves at a different angle&#44; diffraction is when a radio wave passes around an object&#44;
        scattering is when a radio wave breaks up in to multiple signals out of phase with the original signal&#44; amplification is when the signal is boosted&#44; attenuation reduces signal activity&#44; a multi&#45;path signal is when the radio
        wave
        is reflected or refracted and has broken up and out of phase from the original signal&#44; radio frequency interference can be electrical noise or interference from weather or other devices&#46;</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Radio waves require power</h3>

    <p class="text-center">RF power is expressed in Watts</p>
	
    <div class="container">
      <p>1 Watt &#40;W&#41; &#61; 1 amp of current at 1 Volt&#44; basic RF power measurements can be from milliwatts &#40;mW&#41; to thousands of Watts&#44; wireless technologies are usually expressed in milliwatts &#40;mW&#41; Gain: is increased
        amplitude resulting from increasing power by optimal antenna use&#46; Loss is a decrease in amplitude by decreasing power these are measured in decibels &#40;dB&#41; based on absolute power&#44; decibels correlate to Watts uses factors of 3
        and
        10 to convert</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <p class="text-center">1 mW &#61; 0 dB&#44; 10 mW &#61; 10 dB&#44; 1 W &#61; 30 dB</p>

      <p>dBm decibels with reference to milliwatts the relationship between decibels and Watts is logarithmic the formula is P &#40;dBm&#41; &#61; 10* &#40;log&#40;P&#40;mw&#41;&#41;&#41; a shortcut method uses 3 and 10 to calculate&#46;</p>

      <p>The range of a RF signal depends on several factors&#44; power&#44; frequency and interference with an increase in power there&#39;s an increase in range a decrease in power a decrease in range&#44; frequency effects range the higher the
        frequency the shorter the waves and the lower the frequency the longer the waves and under the same amount of power lower frequencies travel father 802&#46;11b/g have a greater range than 802&#46;11a&#44; interference can limit range&#44;
        electrical noise&#44; weather other transmission can limit the range to combat interference you can use RF shielding&#44; more power&#44; move devices that are creating interference&#46;
        The speeds of wireless networks are measured in bits per second&#44; with older modems connections where measured in Kbps &#40;14&#46;4&#44; 36&#46;6 and 54 Kbps&#41; and modern LAN speeds are 10&#47;100 and 1000 Mbps &#40;Gigabit

     <h2 id="settingup" class="text-center">Setting up a wireless network</h2>
    
    <div class="container">
      <p>The router connects to the internet via a cable or DSL modem giving internet access to all the computers on the network&#44; you can also enable file and printer sharing for all the computers throughout the network&#46; Care should be taken
        in selecting the best place to set up the modem and router&#44; normally a central position to give the best signal coverage for the wireless throughout the building where the network is going to be set up&#46; After selecting the best place
        to set up the modem and router you need to connect them to each other&#44; you will also need to reset the appliances in order for them to communicate with each other correctly&#46;</p>

      <p>You may need to install wireless network cards to the computers on the network that don&#39;t already have wireless functionality this can be done by inserting PCI or PCIe network cards or external USB connectors for desktop computers&#44;
        with laptop computers if the wireless functionality is not already built into the computer you can use PC card&#44; Cardbus or Express cards inserted in to a external expansion slot&#46; Remember to install the drivers for any of the network
        cards first before installing the cards into the computer this enables the computer to recognise the new hardware and assists in making the correct configurations&#44; it&#39;s usually best to read the manual that comes with the device to
        check for the correct installation procedure and it&#39;s recommended that you check the manufacturers web site for any driver updates and make sure you&#39;ve made a backup of the existing drivers before installing the upgrade&#46;</p>
    </div>
    <h3 class="text-center">Configuring the router</h3>
	
     <div class="container">
      <p>After connecting the router to the modem you need to configure the router this requires you to open internet explorer or whatever network browser you use and typing in the routers IP address this is usually 192&#46;168&#46;0&#46;1 or
        192&#46;168&#46;1&#46;1 and you should arrive at the routers login screen&#44; the user name and password are usually admin by default which you will need to change for security reasons&#44; there will be various screens and different tabs to
        give you access to the various configurations that need to be made to the router depending on the make and model but the basic setup procedure should be similar on all makes of routers&#46;</p>

      <p>The SSID Service set identification is the name of the wireless network&#44; the wireless router will have a default name and will be enabled to broadcast the name for security purposes it&#39;s best to change the name of the SSID and to
        disable it from broadcasting the name&#44; you should also use MAC filtering which allows only specific MAC addresses to connect to the network&#46; Check the mode setting this will be governed by the network cards on the computers that are
        going to be networked; a modern network would most likely be the IEEE 802&#46;11g or 802&#46;11n standards&#46; You will also need to set the channel these are numbered from 1 to 14 and most routers are normally set to channel 1&#44; 6 and 11
        because these frequencies don&#39;t overlap but on most modern routers this is auto-configured to scan for other network channels that are broadcasting nearby&#46;</p>

      <p>If your equipment can only use WEP encryption you will need to set the security mode WEP &#40;Wired equivalent privacy&#41;&#44; this uses 40 bit and 104 bit encryption but uses a static shared key this is now regarded has low security and
        easy break into so it&#39;s recommended not to use it&#44; modern wireless networks should be set to WPA personal or WPA2 &#40;Wi&#45;Fi protected access&#41;&#44;encryption improving wireless security this is also known as PSK or PSK2 in
        some routers&#44; there is also a setting for the cipher type TKIP &#40;Temporal key integrity protocol&#41; or AES &#40;Advanced encryption standard&#41;&#44; AES being more secure but this would depend on whether the wireless card supports
        this&#44;</p>

      <p>There is a setting to set a pre-shared key this can use 8 &#45; 63 ASCII characters and it is definitely worth using the full 63 random characters to be secure&#44; this can be done by typing upper and lower case letters&#44; numbers into a
        word program such as notepad etc and copying and pasting the key into all the other computers on the network this word file can be put on a USB flash drive to achieve this&#44; on most good routers there is a feature that updates the key
        which basically scrambles this key every few seconds making it impossible for hackers using sniffing tools to break the password&#46;</p>

      <p>Make sure the time and date settings are setup correctly this will help when you setup any access restrictions this is normally done by a wizard that guides you through the steps and you can then set up a access policy putting internet
        restrictions on any of the computers on the network&#46; You might need to input the computers Mac address you can find this from the command prompt by selecting start &#45; run and type in cmd and pressing enter this should open the command
        prompt where you need to type in the command <span class="bold">ipconfig &#47;all</span> and press enter and if you look in the list you should see a group of hexadecimal numbers and letters corresponding with the physical address this is the
        computers Mac address&#46;</p>

      <p>To setup the wireless network in Windows you will need to access network connections this can be accessed by either right clicking on the wireless connection icon in the system tray or from the start menu by either selecting network
        connections or from the control panel and selecting the network and sharing centre icon and selecting the manage network connections&#44; then select the icon for the wireless network and right click on the icon and select properties then
        highlight internet protocol version 4 or Internet protocol TCP&#47;IP and select properties and make sure the obtain IP address automatically as well as the obtain DNS server address automatically boxes are ticked&#44; The DHCP server should
        then assign these addresses automatically&#46;</p>

      <p>To setup file and printer sharing you first need to disable the software firewalls on the computers you going to use on the network&#44; this will be enabled again after the network as been configured you have the protection of a hardware
        firewall that&#39;s built into the router so you should still have protection&#46; Right click on my computer and select properties to change the name of the computer and the select the membership to workgroup&#44; first is file and folder
        sharing to check that everything is setup and running correctly right click on a file or folder you wish to share and select sharing and security and follow the wizard to share the file or folder over the network once this is successful you
        have a good idea you network is working properly&#46;</p>

      <p>The next task is to make sure your printer is connected and working properly select start printers and faxes select the printer you wish to network right click on it and select share&#44; you need to check that there are no protocols other
        than the network protocol added to the printer and file sharing as this can prevent the printer from working properly&#44; this can be changed in network connections under the advanced menu and then advanced settings&#46;</p>

      <p>Troubleshooting wireless networks interference can be a problem using wireless&#44; microwave ovens&#44; fluorescent lights&#44; cordless telephones&#44; high power sources can all course interference with the signal&#44; there are some
        commands that can be used <span class="bold">netstat &#47;e</span> in Windows and netstat i in Linux&#44; all of the devices on your network should be using the same encryption TKIP &#40;Temporal key integrity protocol&#41; or AES
        &#40;Advanced encryption standard&#41; WPA2 uses a pre-shared key &#40;PSK&#41; for authentication&#46;</p>
