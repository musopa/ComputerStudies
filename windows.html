      <p>The first version of Microsoft Windows&#44; version 1&#46;0&#44; released in November 1985&#44; lacked a degree of functionality&#44; achieved little popularity and was to compete with Apple&#39;s own operating system&#46; Windows 1&#46;0 is
        not a complete operating system; rather&#44; it extends MS&#45;DOS&#46; Microsoft Windows version 2&#46;0 was released in November 1987 and was slightly more popular than its predecessor&#46; Windows 2&#46;03 &#40;release date January
        1988&#41; had changed the OS from tiled windows to overlapping windows&#46; The result of this change led to Apple Computer filing a suit against Microsoft alleging infringement on Apple&#39;s copyrights&#46;</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">The Windows family tree</h3>
	
    <div class="container">
      <p>Microsoft Windows version 3&#46;0&#44; released in 1990&#44; was the first Microsoft Windows version to achieve broad commercial success&#44; selling 2 million copies in the first six months&#46; It featured improvements to the user
        interface and to multitasking capabilities&#46; It received a facelift in Windows 3&#46;1&#44; made generally available on March 1&#44; 1992&#46; Windows 3&#46;1 support ended on December 31&#44; 2001&#46;</p>

      <p>In July 1993&#44; Microsoft released Windows NT based on a new kernel&#46; Windows NT 3&#46;1 was the first release of Windows NT&#46; NT was considered to be the professional OS and was the first Windows version to utilize preemptive
        multitasking&#46; Windows NT would later be retooled to also function as a home operating system&#44; with Windows XP&#46;</p>

      <p>On August 24&#44; 1995&#44; Microsoft released Windows 95&#44; a new&#44; and major&#44; consumer version that made further changes to the user interface&#44; and also used preemptive multitasking&#46; Windows 95 was designed to replace not
        only Windows 3&#46;1&#44; but also Windows for Workgroups&#44; and MS&#45;DOS&#46; It was also the first Windows operating system to include object oriented document management and use Plug and Play capabilities&#46; The changes Windows 95
        brought to the desktop were revolutionary&#44; as opposed to evolutionary&#44; such as those in Windows 98 and Windows Me&#46; Mainstream support for Windows 95 ended on December 31&#44; 2000 and extended support for Windows 95 ended on
        December 31&#44; 2001&#46;</p>

      <p>Next in the consumer line was Microsoft Windows 98 released on June 25&#44; 1998&#46; It was followed with the release of Windows 98 Second Edition &#40;Windows 98 SE&#41; in 1999&#46; Mainstream support for Windows 98 ended on June 30&#44;
        2002 and extended support for Windows 98 ended on July 11&#44; 2006&#46;</p>

      <p>As part of its &#34;professional&#34; line&#44; Microsoft released Windows 2000 in February 2000&#46; During 2004 part of the Source Code for Windows 2000 was leaked onto the Internet&#46; This was bad for Microsoft as the same kernel used
        in Windows 2000 was used in Windows XP&#46; The consumer version following Windows 98 was Windows Me &#40;Windows Millennium Edition). Released in September 2000&#44; Windows Me implemented a number of new technologies for Microsoft: most
        notably publicized was &#34;Universal Plug and Play&#34;&#46; Windows Me was heavily criticized due to slowness&#44; freezes and hardware problems&#46;</p>

      <p>In October 2001&#44; Microsoft released Windows XP&#44; a version built on the Windows NT kernel that also retained the consumer&#45;oriented usability of Windows 95 and its successors&#46; This new version was widely praised in computer
        magazines&#46; It shipped in two distinct editions&#44; &#34;Home&#34; and &#34;Professional&#34;&#44;, the former lacking many of the superior security and networking features of the Professional edition&#46; Additionally&#44; the first
        &#34;Media Center&#34; edition was released in 2002&#44; with an emphasis on support for DVD and TV functionality including program recording and a remote control&#46; Mainstream support for Windows XP ended on April 14&#44; 2009&#46;
        Extended support will continue until April 8&#44; 2014&#46;</p>

      <p>In April 2003&#44; Windows Server 2003 was introduced&#44; replacing the Windows 2000 line of server products with a number of new features and a strong focus on security; this was followed in December 2005 by Windows Server 2003 R2&#46;</p>

      <p>On January 30&#44; 2007&#44; Microsoft released Windows Vista&#46; It contains a number of new features&#44; from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant technical changes&#44; with a particular focus on security features&#46;
        It is available in a number of different editions&#44; and has been subject to some criticism&#46;</p>

      <p>On October 22&#44; 2009&#44; Microsoft released Windows 7&#46; Unlike its predecessor&#44; Windows Vista&#44; which introduced a large number of new features&#44; Windows 7 was intended to be a more focused&#44; incremental upgrade to the
        Windows line&#44; with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware which Windows Vista was not at the time&#46; Windows 7 has multi&#45;touch support&#44; a redesigned Windows shell with a new taskbar&#44; referred to as the
        Superbar&#44; a home networking system called HomeGroup&#44; and performance improvements&#46;</p>

      <p>On February 29&#44; 2012&#44; Microsoft released Windows 8 Consumer Preview&#44; the beta version of Windows 8&#44; build 8250&#46; For the first time since Windows 95&#44; the Start button is no longer available on the taskbar&#44; though
        the Start screen is still triggered by clicking the bottom&#45;left corner of the screen and by clicking Start in the Charm&#46; Windows president Steven Sinofsky said more than 100&#44;000 changes had been made since the developer version
        went public&#46; In the first day of its release&#44; Windows 8 Consumer Preview was downloaded over one million times&#46; Microsoft released the Windows 8 Release Preview&#44; Build 8400 on June 1&#44; 2012&#46; Like the Developer
        Preview&#44; the Consumer Preview and the Release Preview are both set to expire on January 15&#44; 2013&#46;

        <p>Windows 8&#46;1 is a personal computer operating system that was produced by Microsoft and released as part of the Windows NT family of operating systems&#46; It was released to manufacturing on August 27&#44; 2013&#44; and reached general
          availability on October 17&#44; 2013&#44; about a year after the retail release of its predecessor 8&#46; Windows 8&#46;1 was made available as a free upgrade for retail copies of Windows 8 and Windows RT users via the Windows Store&#46;
        </p>

        <p>On September 30&#44; 2014&#44; Microsoft announced Windows 10 as the successor to Windows 8&#46;1&#46; It was released on July 29&#44; 2015&#44; and addresses shortcomings in the user interface first introduced with Windows 8&#46; Changes
          on PC include the return of the Start Menu&#44; a virtual desktop system&#44; and the ability to run Windows Store apps within windows on the desktop rather than in full-screen mode&#46; Windows 10 is said to be available to update from
          qualified Windows 7 with SP1&#44; Windows 8&#46;1 and Windows Phone 8&#46;1 devices from the Get Windows 10 Application (for Windows 7&#44; Windows 8&#46;1) or Windows Update (Windows 7)&#46; </p>

	<div class="container">
      <p>It is really important to do some maintenance on the regular basis if you want get lot out of surfing the web&#46; Depending on how much time you spend on surfing it is a good idea to clean your DNS cache once in a while&#46; I suggest doing
        this every month if you are using internet more than two hours a day&#46; When you visit a website&#44; Windows tries to speed things up by placing the DNS information about that site&#44; into a DNS cache on your PC&#46; This is OK until
        there
        are problems with outside networks &#40;WAN&#41;&#44; DNS servers or even the website&#33; </p>

      <p>DNS Windows cache stores BOTH negative and positive entries&#46; The positive entries are those that the DNS query was correct and you could connect to the website&#46; Negative entries are those where the DNS query failed and you could not
        connect to the website&#46;</p>

      <p>A problem can arise here because if the DNS cache holds a negative entry and the website you want to view is now OK to view&#44; Windows will still give you a DNS error&#33;</p>

      <p>Understanding hardware and software system layers in a PC&#44; if your troubleshooting a problem in a PC you need to figure out if it&#39;s hardware or software related&#44; if it&#39;s a software problem you would reload the software&#44;
        changing the drivers or the configurations of the software&#44; if it&#39;s a hardware related problem you would replace the hardware that&#39;s defected&#44; a motherboard&#44; a disk drive&#44; a video card&#44; cables etc&#46;</p>

      <p>There are four layers in a PC the hardware&#44; the BIOS&#44; the operating system and the application&#44; the application program communicates with the operating system through a standard interface known as the API &#40;Application program
        interface&#41; this could be a program such as Microsoft word which then translates the data in the word program via the operating system to the BIOS &#40;Basic input output system&#41; layer which in turn translates the data to the systems
        hardware where the word document can be saved to the hard drive in its binary data form&#46;</p>

      <p>Exploring the BIOS and drivers in a PC&#44; If you think of BIOS as being all of the drivers for all of the hardware in a system&#44; you have keyboard drivers&#44; hard disk driver&#39;s&#44; video drivers&#44; drivers for your I&#47;O
        ports so all of the drivers make up the BIOS&#44; the BIOS is the interface between the hardware and the operating system&#44; although the hardware may be different from system to system you need to have the correct drivers for each
        individual piece of hardware to communicate properly with the operating system so you need to make sure the drivers are the correct ones for the particular operating system in use on the system for example the drivers would be different for
        Windows 2000 as for operating systems such as Windows XP or Vista even though they&#39;re all versions of Windows operating systems&#46;</p>

      <p>The ROM BIOS&#44; there are three major BIOS manufacturers AMI&#44; Phoenix and Award&#44; the main difference between RAM and ROM is that RAM is volatile so when the power is cut from the motherboard you lose the data and with ROM which is
        non&#45;volatile the data remains in the memory&#46; The fundamental difference between BIOS and CMOS is that BIOS is a set of instructions or code used to communicate with system devices and CMOS is an inventory list of the configurations
        and settings for the system devices&#46;</p>

    <div class="container">
      <p>You can use Windows Performance Monitor to examine how programs you run affect your computer&#39;s performance&#44; both in real time and by collecting log data for later analysis</p>

      <p>Windows Performance Monitor uses performance counters&#44; event trace data&#44; and configuration information&#44; which can be combined into Data Collector Sets</p>

      <p>Performance counters are measurements of system state or activity&#46; They can be included in the operating system or can be part of individual applications&#46; Windows Performance Monitor requests the current value of performance counters
        at specified time intervals</p>

      <p>Event trace data is collected from trace providers&#44; which are components of the operating system or of individual applications that report actions or events&#46; Output from multiple trace providers can be combined into a trace session
      </p>

      <p>Configuration information is collected from key values in the Windows registry&#46; Windows Performance Monitor can record the value of a registry key at a specified time or interval as part of a log file</p>

    <div class="container">
      <p>The Device Manager is a Control Panel applet in Microsoft Windows operating systems&#46; It allows users to view and control the hardware attached to the computer&#46; When a piece of hardware is not working&#44; the offending hardware is
        highlighted for the user to deal with&#46;</p>

      <p>Device Manager was introduced with Windows 95 and later added to Windows 2000&#46; In NT&#45;based versions&#44; it is included as a Microsoft Management Console snap&#45;in&#46;</p>

      <p>The operating system doesn&#39;t know how to talk directly to most hardware so device drivers are needed to assist this process&#44; device drivers are hardware and operating system specific so Windows XP device drivers won&#39;t work with
        Windows Vista or Windows 7 and vice a versa</p>

      <p>A disabled device has either been manually disabled by a user or by some way of error&#46; In Windows 7&#44; this is denoted by a grey downward pointing arrow in the lower right&#45;hand corner of the device&#39;s icon&#44; or a red X in
        some
        older versions of Microsoft Windows&#46;</p>

      <p>Hardware may not work properly for a multitude of reasons&#46; If Windows recognizes a problem with a device&#44; it is denoted by a black exclamation point &#40;&#33;&#41; on a yellow triangle in the lower right&#45;hand corner of the
        device&#39;s icon&#46;</p>

      <p>Hardware may not be recognized if it is not installed properly or not compatible with your system&#46; This is denoted by a yellow question mark in place of the device&#39;s icon&#46;</p>

      <p>A blue &#34;i&#34; on a white field in the lower right&#45;hand corner of a Device&#39;s icon indicates that the Use automatic settings feature is not selected for the device and that the resource was manually selected&#46; Note that this
